# PersonalPortfolioReactApp
This is my React based Personal Portfolio Website to demonstrate my knowledge, understanding and technical capabilites in web development.
I have built this website to try learn and explore various functionalities of React such as Functional Components, Hooks, State management, Bootstrap and simply to play with HTML,CSS and JS.
This website is currently hosted via Azure Static Web Apps because it provides built-in CI/CD and API functionality using Azure functions.
I have many-many ideas which I'd to do with this website.
This is going to be a long and awesome project.
I have given myself 6 months to complete this project before moving on to some other project.

You're free to fork, download and modify the code. However, I DO NOT grant my consent to ANYONE to misuse,alter/temper my personal images and data in this website/app for any reasons whatsoever.

Cheers!
